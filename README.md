### org.eclipse.jdt:org.eclipse.jdt.core 3.37.0

JDT core 3.36.0 and 3.37.0 introduce a bug which prevent analysis of files when there are semantic problems.
The `ProblemReporter` could have a null `referenceContext` during the resolution of `unknown types` which produces
`AbortCompilation` exception, instead of adding the semantic problems to the compilation result.
The logic in `ProblemReporter` is sometimes wrong, and it wrongly set `referenceContext` to null.
For the Java analyzer, it's an important problem because even when the semantic is not 100% resolved, we still want
to analyze the source code. And this bug also silently prevent the following files in the same compilation batch to be analyzed.

Modified source code in the `SONARJAVA-4921 Fix the referenceContext == null problem` commit:
